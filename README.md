# Simple Penalty Die
This [FoundryVTT](https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt) module introduces a simple and automatic applied penalty die to certain rolls for the system [dnd5e](https://github.com/foundryvtt/dnd5e), 
following the specificed Exhaustion Rules.

# New Exhaustion Rules
At each level of exhaustion you gain a penalty die size. Any time you make an ability check,
saving throw, or attack roll, you subtract your penalty die value from your total. Penalty
die replace the one from the previous level.

| 1  |  1d4 |
| 2  |  1d6 |
| 3  |  1d8 |
| 4  |  1d10 |
| 5  |  1d12 |
